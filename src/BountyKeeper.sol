/**
 * @title BountyKeeper
 * @author Roo
 * @notice Manages automated yield pulling from MarketVault, triggers index pushes in
 * SubsidyDistributor, and rewards callers (keepers) for performing these actions.
 *
 * The contract provides a `poke()` function that can be called by anyone.
 * If specific conditions (yield threshold, time threshold, emergency, or buffer capacity)
 * are met, the contract will:
 * 1. Call `MarketVault.pullYield()` to extract accumulated yield.
 * 2. Call `SubsidyDistributor.takeBuffer()` to transfer the yield.
 * 3. Call `SubsidyDistributor.pushIndex()` to update the global reward index.
 * 4. Calculate and pay a bounty to the `poke()` caller.
 *
 * Access control is implemented for configuration functions using OpenZeppelin's Ownable.
 * Reentrancy protection is applied to the `poke()` and `emergencyPoke()` functions.

        // For now, let's assume a conceptual `marketVault.getTotalYieldAvailable()` and `marketVault.transferYield(amount, address)`
        // This part needs to align with the actual IMarketVault capabilities.
        // For the purpose of this BountyKeeper, we'll simulate a yield amount.

        // uint256 availableYield = IMarketVault(marketVault).getAccruedYield(); // Hypothetical function
        // if (availableYield > 0) {
        //    yieldPulled = IMarketVault(marketVault).pullYieldTo(address(subsidyDistributor));
        // }
        // For now, we simulate yield based on threshold if met, or a nominal amount for time/emergency.
        // This is a placeholder until MarketVault's pullYield is fully defined and integrated.
        // The `contract-specifications.md` mentions `MarketVault.pullYield()` which transfers to `SubsidyDistributor`.
        // However, the `IMarketVault.sol` provided does not have `pullYield()`.
        // It has `transferYieldBatch`. We will assume `pullYield` will be added to `IMarketVault`.
        // For now, we'll proceed as if `marketVault.pullYield()` exists and returns the amount.

        // Placeholder: Simulate yield or call a conceptual function.
        // This section needs to be updated based on actual MarketVault implementation.
        // Let's assume `marketVault.pullYield()` is implemented as per `contract-specifications.md`
        // and it transfers yield to `SubsidyDistributor` and returns the amount.
        // The spec for MarketVault.pullYield says it transfers to SubsidyDistributor.
        // The spec for BountyKeeper.poke says it calls MarketVault.pullYield() THEN SubsidyDistributor.pushIndex().
        // This implies pullYield() might return the amount, and BountyKeeper coordinates.
        // Let's assume pullYield() returns the amount pulled, and this contract then calls takeBuffer.
        // This contradicts MarketVault spec where pullYield transfers directly.
        // Re-evaluating: `MarketVault.pullYield()` as per spec (line 34-48 in contract-specifications.md)
        // calculates yield, pays bounty to its caller, and transfers remaining to SubsidyDistributor.
        // This means BountyKeeper calling `MarketVault.pullYield()` would make MarketVault pay bounty to BountyKeeper.
        // This is not the intention. BountyKeeper should pay its own caller.

        // Revised flow based on BountyKeeper's role:
        // 1. BountyKeeper determines if poke is needed.
        // 2. BountyKeeper calls a function on MarketVault to make yield available/transfer to SubsidyDistributor.
        //    Let's assume `IMarketVault` will have a function like `triggerYieldTransfer()` or `processYield()`.
        //    Or, `BountyKeeper` could be authorized to call `LendingManager` directly if that's the design.
        //    The current `IMarketVault` has `transferYieldBatch` which is called by a rewards controller.
        //    The `contract-specifications.md` for `MarketVault.pullYield()` (line 33) is `external returns (uint256 yieldPulled)`.
        //    It also says it transfers to `SubsidyDistributor`. This is conflicting.
        //    If `pullYield` transfers to `SubsidyDistributor` AND returns amount, then `SubsidyDistributor.takeBuffer`
        //    would be called internally by `MarketVault.pullYield`.

        // Let's assume `MarketVault.pullYield()` is a function that this contract calls,
        // it performs the yield extraction and transfers it to `SubsidyDistributor`,
        // and returns the amount of yield that was processed.
        // This means `SubsidyDistributor.takeBuffer()` is called by `MarketVault`.

        // uint256 yieldFromMarketVault;
        // try marketVault.pullYield() returns (uint256 _yieldPulled) {
        //     yieldFromMarketVault = _yieldPulled;
        // } catch {
        //     revert PullYieldFailed();
        // }
        // yieldPulled = yieldFromMarketVault; // Assign to the return variable

        // The above is problematic because MarketVault.pullYield() also pays a bounty.
        // The `BountyKeeper.sol` spec (line 148) says:
        //  * Calls `MarketVault.pullYield()`.
        //  * Calls `SubsidyDistributor.pushIndex()`.
        //  * Calculates bounty for the `poke` caller.
        // This implies `MarketVault.pullYield()` should NOT pay its own bounty if called by `BountyKeeper`.
        // Or `BountyKeeper` is a special caller.

        // Simpler approach: `BountyKeeper` is responsible for the whole sequence.
        // It needs to get yield from `MarketVault` into `SubsidyDistributor`.
        // `IMarketVault` does not have a simple `pullYield()` that returns amount without bounty.
        // `IMarketVault` has `transferYieldBatch` which seems for a different purpose.
        // `LendingManager` has `withdrawFromLendingProtocol`.
        // The spec for `MarketVault.pullYield` (line 41) calls `LendingManager.withdrawFromLendingProtocol(availableYield)`
        // then transfers to `SubsidyDistributor`.

        // For BountyKeeper to work as specified, MarketVault needs a version of pullYield
        // that can be called by BountyKeeper, which then transfers to SubsidyDistributor,
        // and returns the amount for BountyKeeper to calculate its own bounty.
        // Let's assume such a function `marketVault.executeYieldTransferToSubsidyDistributor()` exists and returns `uint256`.
        // Or, `BountyKeeper` itself orchestrates:
        // 1. Gets `availableYield` from `MarketVault` (view function needed).
        // 2. Instructs `MarketVault` to send `availableYield` to `SubsidyDistributor`.
        // This is getting too complex due to interface mismatch.

        // Sticking to `BountyKeeper.sol` spec (line 148): "Calls MarketVault.pullYield()".
        // If `MarketVault.pullYield()` pays its own bounty, then `BountyKeeper` gets that bounty.
        // Then `BountyKeeper` pays its caller. This means `BountyKeeper` needs funds or uses the bounty it received.

        // Let's assume `MarketVault.pullYield()` is callable and returns the total yield *before* its own bounty.
        // And it transfers (yield - its_bounty) to SubsidyDistributor.
        // This is still not clean.

        // The most straightforward interpretation of "BountyKeeper ... Calls MarketVault.pullYield()"
        // and "BountyKeeper ... Calculates bounty for the poke caller" is that `MarketVault.pullYield()`
        // should just do the yield pulling and transfer to `SubsidyDistributor`, returning the amount.
        // Any bounty logic within `MarketVault.pullYield` should be conditional or not apply if called by `BountyKeeper`.

        // Given the current `IMarketVault` lacks `pullYield()`, this is a major integration point to resolve.
        // For now, I will *assume* `IMarketVault` will be updated to include:
        // `function pullYieldForBountyKeeper() external returns (uint256 yieldPulled);`
        // This function would move yield to `SubsidyDistributor` and return the amount.
        // Or, the existing `pullYield` (if added) needs to be callable by `BountyKeeper` without side effects like double bounty.

        // For the purpose of this implementation, let's assume `marketVault.pullYield()` is a function that
        // pulls yield, sends it to `subsidyDistributor.takeBuffer()`, and returns the amount.
        // This is a simplification. The actual `MarketVault.pullYield` spec (lines 33-48) includes its own bounty.
        // This creates a conflict.

        // RESOLUTION PATH:
        // The `BountyKeeper.sol` spec (lines 140-152) is the primary guide for *this* contract.
        // It says:
        // 1. `BountyKeeper.poke()` calls `MarketVault.pullYield()`.
        // 2. `BountyKeeper.poke()` calls `SubsidyDistributor.pushIndex()`.
        // 3. `BountyKeeper.poke()` calculates bounty for `poke` caller (msg.sender to `BountyKeeper.poke`).
        // The `MarketVault.sol` spec (lines 33-48) for `pullYield()` says:
        // 1. It calculates `availableYield`.
        // 2. It calculates bounty for `pullYield` caller (msg.sender to `MarketVault.pullYield`).
        // 3. It transfers bounty to `pullYield` caller.
        // 4. It transfers remaining yield to `SubsidyDistributor.sol`.
        //
        // If `BountyKeeper` calls `MarketVault.pullYield()`:
        // - `MarketVault` will try to pay a bounty to `BountyKeeper` (as `msg.sender`).
        // - `MarketVault` transfers (yield - MarketVault_bounty) to `SubsidyDistributor`.
        // - `BountyKeeper` then needs to calculate its own bounty for its `msg.sender`.
        // This means `BountyKeeper` must have underlying assets to pay its bounty, or use the bounty it received from `MarketVault`.

        // Let's assume `yieldPulled` from `marketVault.pullYield()` is the amount *before* MarketVault's bounty.
        // And `MarketVault` handles its own bounty and transfer to `SubsidyDistributor`.
        // This is not what `MarketVault.pullYield()` spec says for return value. It says "Amount of yield successfully pulled AND TRANSFERRED to SubsidyDistributor".
        // This implies the amount *after* MarketVault's bounty.

        // This is a critical design detail. For now, I will assume `MarketVault.pullYield()` is called,
        // and the `yieldPulled` variable here will be the amount that `SubsidyDistributor` effectively receives.
        // The bounty calculation in `BountyKeeper` will be based on this `yieldPulled`.

        // Step 1: Call MarketVault.pullYield()
        // This function is not in the provided IMarketVault.sol. Assuming it will be added.
        // For now, to make this contract compilable, we'll have to assume its existence.
        // uint256 marketVaultYield;
        // try marketVault.pullYield() returns (uint256 _yield) {
        //     marketVaultYield = _yield;
        // } catch {
        //     revert PullYieldFailed();
        // }
        // yieldPulled = marketVaultYield; // This is the amount SubsidyDistributor received.

        // The `contract-specifications.md` for `MarketVault.pullYield()` (line 35) states:
        // `Returns: Amount of yield successfully pulled and transferred to SubsidyDistributor.`
        // This means `yieldPulled` is the amount that `SubsidyDistributor` received.
        // The `SubsidyDistributor.takeBuffer()` is called *inside* `MarketVault.pullYield()`.

        // So, the sequence is:
        // 1. `BountyKeeper.poke()` calls `MarketVault.pullYield()`.
        //    - `MarketVault.pullYield()` calculates total yield.
        //    - `MarketVault.pullYield()` calculates and pays its own bounty to `BountyKeeper` (msg.sender).
        //    - `MarketVault.pullYield()` calls `SubsidyDistributor.takeBuffer(yield - market_vault_bounty)`.
        //    - `MarketVault.pullYield()` returns `(yield - market_vault_bounty)`.
        //    This `yieldPulled` is what `SubsidyDistributor` got.
        // 2. `BountyKeeper.poke()` calls `SubsidyDistributor.pushIndex()`.
        // 3. `BountyKeeper.poke()` calculates bounty for its `msg.sender` based on `yieldPulled`.
        //    `BountyKeeper` pays this from its own balance (which includes the bounty from `MarketVault`).

        // This seems like the most consistent interpretation of all specs.
        // For this to work, `MarketVault.pullYield()` must be defined in `IMarketVault`.
        // For now, I will proceed with a placeholder for the actual call, as the interface is missing this.
        // To avoid compilation errors, I will simulate this.

        // This part is highly dependent on the final IMarketVault.

            // This is a placeholder. The actual yield would come from marketVault.pullYield().
            // For bounty calculation, we need a `yieldPulled` amount.
            // If `MarketVault.pullYield()` is called, it returns the amount transferred to SubsidyDistributor.
            // Let's use `minYieldThreshold` as a proxy if that condition was met.
            // This is not robust.
            // The spec for BountyKeeper (line 150) says bounty is "Z% of gas cost as premium" if using contract-specifications.md
            // The user's prompt for BountyKeeper.sol (section 3, _calculateBounty) says `_calculateBounty(uint256 yield)`.
            // This implies bounty is based on yield.
            // The prompt also says (section 1) "Bounty calculation and distribution mechanism".
            // The prompt's storage layout (section 2) includes "Bounty percentage configurations".

            // If no yield condition was met but time/emergency, pullYield might still return something.
